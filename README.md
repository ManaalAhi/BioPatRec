BioPatRec is a research platform (on MATLAB) that allows you to easily implement algorithms to be tested in a real-life and challenging problem: The control of artificial limbs via the decoding (or pattern recognition) of bioelectric signals. Algorithms in the following areas apply:

* Signal processing
* Features extraction and selection
* Pattern recognition (machine learning) or model-based decoders
* Real-time control

BioPatRec is a modular platform that allows you to focus in your particular interest and simply use the other modules as support for the evaluation of your algorithm. This includes a Virtual Reality Environment for a qualitative and quantitative performance evaluation.
