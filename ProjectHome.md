# BioPatRec #

BioPatRec is a research platform (on MATLAB) that allows you to easily implement algorithms to be tested in a real-life and challenging problem: The control of artificial limbs through pattern recognition of bioelectric signals. Algorithms in the following areas apply:

  * Signal processing
  * Features extraction and selection
  * Pattern recognition
  * Real-time control

BioPatRec is a modular platform that allows you to focus in your particular interest and simply use the other modules as support for the evaluation of your algorithm. This includes a _Virtual Reality Environment_ for a qualitative and quantitative performance evaluation.
