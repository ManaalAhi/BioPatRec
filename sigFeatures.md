  * sF (sampling frequency)
  * tW (time window)
  * nCh (number of channels)
  * mov (movements)
  * dev (device used for recordings)
  * fFilter (frequency filter)
  * sFilter (spatial filter)
  * trSets (training sets, number)

This structure contains the signal features to be used for pattern recognition. These are the training, validation and testing sets (see [xSets](xSets.md) created in PatRec).
